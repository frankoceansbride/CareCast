CareCast
Healthcare Predictive Analytics
CareCast is a machine learning project designed to predict healthcare outcomes, such as patient readmission risk, using advanced predictive analytics and secure data handling practices.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform healthcare datasets for analysis.
Predictive Modeling: Implements machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for accurate predictions.
Outcome Evaluation: Includes metrics like ROC-AUC for model evaluation, achieving 15% accuracy improvement over baseline models.
Project Structure:
data_preprocessing.py: Prepares datasets by handling missing values and feature engineering.
train_model.py: Trains and optimizes the machine learning model using scikit-learn.
predict.py: Loads the trained model to make predictions on new patient data.
Technologies Used:
Languages: Python
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, joblib
Tools: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis, Matplotlib for visualization
Results:
Achieved an ROC-AUC score of 0.87, with a 15% improvement in predictive accuracy over baseline models.
Future Enhancements:
Add support for real-time data ingestion.
Implement a web interface for ease of use by healthcare professionals.
