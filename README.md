# Healthcare Predictive Analytics

This project predicts healthcare outcomes (e.g., readmission risk) using machine learning.

## Project Structure
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Preprocesses the data.
- `train_model.py`: Trains and optimizes the model.
- `predict.py`: Loads the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the project.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
   ```
3. Run `train_model.py` to train the model.
4. Run `predict.py` to make predictions.
